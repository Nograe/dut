Artificial intelligence is intelligence displayed by machines, in contrast with natural intelligence displayed by humans and animals.
It's also the ensemble of theories and techniques used to produce machines capable of simulating intelligence.
It's more of a set of concepts and technologies than a discipline in its own right.
AI is often ranked with cognitive science, mathematical logic and computer science.
Its use and development have always generated fantasies, concerns and misconceptions.

AI finds its starting point back in the 1950s with Alan Turing. He wondered if a machine could "think".
In 1950, he proposed a test to determine the intelligence of a machine, now known as the Turing test.
The term "Artificial Intelligence" was coined by John McCarthy in a summer workshop at Darmouth College in 1956.
By the middle of the 1960s, the research in the U.S. was heavily funded by the Department of Defense.

On 11 May 1997, Deep Blue became the first computer to beat the world chess champion.
In 2011, Watson, the IBM "question answering system" defeated the two Jeopardy champions.
In May 2016, AlphaGo defeated the world Go champion.

In 1985, the market for AI had reached over a billion dollars.
In 2018, it will be over 4 billion dollars.


Artificial intelligence today is a narrow AI (or weak AI): it's designed to perform a narrow task (e.g. facial recognition / internet searches / driving a car). However, the long-term goal of many researchers is to create general AI (or strong AI), able to outperform humans to almost all cognitive tasks.
